# In Python, when we assign one variable to another (like current = dummy), both variables will refer to the
# same object in memory. However, when we perform assignments such as current = current.next, the variable current
# itself is being reassigned to a different object (i.e., current.next). It doesn't modify the object that dummy
# points to. Let me explain how this works in the context of your question.



            #current new_node = to next node after each iteration (that is the value passed
#from list1 or list2 and) as such in the next iteration we assign the .next value in the next iteration so that
#we keep incrementing. we need to assign the new_node to the most recent assigned .next node after each iteration
# else we will just be changing new_node.next value without adding any more elements to the mergelist as we are iterating



#note new node is just empty at start
# list1 and list2 are not actually lists, but rather linked lists(of ListNode objects). Each element of list1
# and list2 is a ListNode object, and each ListNode has two main attributes:
# val: stores the value of that node.
# next: points to the next node in the
# linked list( or None if 's the last node).

#list1: In this case, list1 is a reference (or pointer) to the first node in the linked list.
# It doesnâ€™t directly hold a list of values, but rather it holds a reference to the first node, which contains
#a value and same goes for list2
